## Export Worksheets to PDF  
  
### Problem Description

Often you will have a nicely setup Excel file with multiple worksheets which include formatted tables and/or charts which you want to export as PDF. The problem is, saving every worksheet manually as PDF takes lots of time.


### Solution

Automate the export function of Excel and use the Worksheet name of each worksheet as the PDF title. This way all our formatted worksheets will get exported nicely and we save a bunch of time :)
